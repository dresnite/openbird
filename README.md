OpenBird
=====

## What is this?

OpenBird is an open-source social network, inspired by Twitter/X. It aims to be a minimalist, stable and highly customizable foundation for creating your own social network.

## Donate (or hire me)

OpenBird is free, but the cost of living is at an all time high. If you'd like to support my mission of building a great open-source social network, consider [making a donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=BBTQDVKJNG3AG) or [hiring me](https://dresnite.com).

## Still not ready

This project is under heavy development, and if you are reading this, it means that it is still not ready to be used by most people.
